# Breakdown of Tasks and Software Development Plan:

### Build Script:
- Create a build script to automatically build library into `.obsidian/plugins` folder.
- Use a module bundler such as Webpack to package the plugin code and assets into a single JS file.
- Create a command to reload the plugin after changes have been made.

### Modularize and Improve Design Patterns:
- Refactor the existing code into smaller, reusable modules.
- Use design patterns such as MVC or Flux to improve code organization and maintainability.
- Use TypeScript to add type checking and improve code robustness.

### Create a Command to Add a New Project in Projects Directory:
- Create a command to prompt the user to enter a new project name.
- Create a new directory for the project in the Projects directory.
- Create a dashboard, tasks directory, and wiki directory for the project.
- Create a template for the dashboard that includes project information, tasks, and wiki links.
- Save the project's GitHub project and wiki URLs in the project's settings or YAML front matter.

### Create a Command to Create a Milestone (and GitHub Issue for this Milestone):
- Create a command to prompt the user to enter a new milestone name and description.
- Create a new GitHub issue for the milestone with the same name and description.
- Save the milestone's GitHub issue URL in the project's settings or YAML front matter.

### Create a Command to Create a Task (with a Dependency to its Milestone):
- Create a command to prompt the user to enter a new task name and description.
- Create a new task template that includes the task name, description, milestone, and dependencies.
- Open the task template for the user to fill in.
- Save the task's GitHub issue URL in the project's settings or YAML front matter.

### Create a Command to Push Changes to GitHub:
- Create a command to push changes to GitHub.
- On load, check all tasks and wiki pages in GitHub against the vault pages.
- If there are differences, pull the changes from GitHub and update the vault pages.
- On exit, push all changes to GitHub.

# Test Cases:
- Test the build script to ensure that the plugin is built and installed correctly.
- Test the commands to add a new project, create a milestone, and create a task to ensure that they work as expected.
- Test the command to push changes to GitHub to ensure that changes are pushed and pulled correctly.
- Test the plugin with different vault configurations and ensure that it works as expected.
